# React State Managers

This project contains five projects created using Vite using five technologies of react state management:

- Context API - https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext
- Redux and Redux Toolkit - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/
- Jotai - https://jotai.org/
- Zustand - https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/
- Recoil - https://recoiljs.org/

To reproduce the state management, I created a simple TODO App and Theme Change Color (Dark mode)
